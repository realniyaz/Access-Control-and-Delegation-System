## Sample MFA Flow Diagram
- User logs in with username and password.
- If valid, prompt for MFA token.
- Verify the token against the secret.
- Allow access if the token is valid.

## Best Practices
- Use secure libraries like speakeasy for TOTP.
- Store the secret key securely (encrypted in your database).
- Educate users to safely store their backup codes.
- Implement a fallback mechanism (e.g., email/SMS OTP) for account recovery.
